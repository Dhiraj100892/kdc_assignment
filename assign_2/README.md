#Part 4 LQR to obtain control gains to keep system upright
To keep the pole in upright position we used lqr. To apply lqr we linearize the model when pole is in its vertical upright position. To obtain the optimal gain we used matlab build in lqr function. We used identity matrix as Q and fixed R to 0.1

Following graph depicts the perfromace of controller in making the pole upright when we start from different intial angle of pole

We used simscape to visualize the system behaviour under this controller.

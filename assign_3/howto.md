put the data file generated from simulation in the direction assign_3/data
(The data dir contains the data file we used for our calculations)
## for part 2A
1) Move to folder 2A
2) run que_2_a_1.m- to get position of COM at t=1 and COM velocity
3) run que_2_a_2.m - to get quaternion of COM
4) run get_com_traj.m - to get the x,y,z trajectory of COM 

## for part 2B
1) Move to folder 2B
2) run que_2_b.m - to get angular velocity with respect to body coordinate frame

## for part 2C
1) Move to folder 2C
2) run que_2_c.m - to get angular acceleration with respect to body coordinate frame

## for part 2D
1) Move to folder 2D
2) run que_2_d.m - to get Moment of inertia with respect to body coordinate frame

## for part 2E
1) Move to folder 2E
2) run que_2_e.m - to get Moment of inertia with respect to body coordinate frame

## for part 3 
1) copy files from folder lander_files to lander folder
2) run apply_offset.m - to get csv trajectory file with offset
3) copy file problem_3.dat into lander folder
4) make
5) ./simulate
6) ./animate
